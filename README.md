Migration Process
The system was completely developed and tested all functionalities in Windows Virtual machine named AlumniProject 
For migration of AIS system to KSU Web server we had discussion with IT team and a separate Linux Server (10.96.60.212) with login credentials are provided
The Linux server can be accessed only within KSU network connected systems with which application has restricted access
FileZilla, a powerful free cross platform software with Client and Server was installed in AlumniProject VM
The Linux Server credentials are used to connect in FileZilla Server and copied all the required project files (php, css) from FileZilla Client (Windows machine). 
The AIS system database (.sql) file was loaded in the Maria DB
The default configuration file and necessary php and sql artifactories are installed, modified using command prompt by connecting to server
With more hours of effort, team work, multiple resource links and code alteration the AIS system was successfully migrated to Linux Server https://10.96.60.212/index.php
